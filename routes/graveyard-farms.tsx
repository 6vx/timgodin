<p>Aren't these things just a cosmic &quot;fuck you&quot; at this point?</p>
<p>It's like a combination of everything wrong with our society.</p>
<p>Instead of growing food, laborers tend to a giant, useless patch of grass.</p>
<p>Instead of building houses for families, craftsmen forge expensive totems to ghosts.</p>
<p>Wealth for wealth's sake, displayed ostentatiously into perpetuity... for what?</p>
<p>Graveyard Farms should replace them. All publicly supported Graveyards must be converted to surplus producing farms by 2035 or be yielded to the state.</p>
<p>HOP on down to the polls. No, like, seriously.</p>
