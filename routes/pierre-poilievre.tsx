<h2>what I know about Pierre</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="pierre-youtube-analysis-1">He's monkeying around with Canadian Politics</a></li>
<li>He's an out of touch career politician</li>
</ul>
<h2>basics</h2>
<p>As I understand it this fella's been a politician his whole life and now is gaming the algorithm with divisiveness to rise to power.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit sketch I gotta say.</p>
<p>If I understood his positive vision and accompanying policy I may change my mind.</p>
<p>But it seems like he just uses negativity to get views and... well damn it's <strong>workin</strong>' but that don't mean it's <strong>good</strong>.</p>
<h2>example</h2>
<p>You only have to watch a few of Pierre's videos to get the idea;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="justin-trudeau">JT</a> bad</li>
<li>CBC bad</li>
<li>world is bad</li>
<li>I, common-sense daddy, will solve all your problems lickety-split. Vote for Pierre. Duh.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's agonizingly transparent... and yet he's approaching half of a million youtube subscribers.</p>
