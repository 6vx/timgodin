        <h1>Pierre Poilievre</h1>
<p>As I understand it this fella's been a politician his whole life and now is gaming the algorithm with divisiveness to rise to power.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit sketch I gotta say.</p>
<p>If I understood his positive vision and accompanying policy I may change my mind.</p>
<p>But it seems like he just uses negativity to get views and... well damn it's <strong>workin</strong>' but that don't mean it's <strong>good</strong>.</p>
