<p>None of the pieces published on this website and on my blog, <a href="https://timgod.in" title="https://timgod.in">timgod.in</a> was written by an AI tool.</p>
<p>I use different tools powered by large language models while brainstorming or researching.</p>
<p>I do not intend to use it in any way that can cause harm to others.</p>
<p>This is an /ai page. You can create one on your website too. If you do, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlse6uqgjy8h4ugks6p0a3lk_ywoskcizzz93rnoh0pf8qycaca/viewform">consider listing it on this public database</a>.</p>
