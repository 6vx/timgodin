        <h1>Artificial ...Intelligence?</h1>
<p>None of the creative writing published on this website,Â <a target="_blank" href="https://timgod.in" title="https://timgod.in">timgod.in</a>, was written by an AI tool.</p>
<p>I use different tools powered by large language models while brainstorming and for making images.</p>
<p>I do not intend to use it in any way that can cause harm to others.</p>
<p>This is an /ai page. You can create one on your website too.</p>
