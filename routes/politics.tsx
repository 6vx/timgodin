    <h1>Politics</h1>
<h2>My Policies</h2>
<p>I have a few controversial opinions of my own that I hope will, in the future, comprise a stalwart platform that gives rise to a '<a href="unity-party">Unity Party</a>' like no other.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="graveyard-farms">Graveyard Farms</a></li>
<li><a href="maid-expansion">MAID Expansion</a></li>
<li><a href="give-quebec-back">Give Quebec Back</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Canadian Politics</h2>
<p>At this point I'm looking at an extremely unserious person using social media divisiveness to try and take power in my country.</p>
<p>This bothers me somewhat.</p>
<p>But it's also kinda the norm around the world right now.</p>
<p>It's also sort've... ironic? How the so-called &quot;Social Media Prime Minister&quot; <a href="justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> is about to be defeated by a walking oxymoron.</p>
<p><a href="pierre-poilievre">Pierre's</a> behaviour appears simply robotic to me, and that was <em>before</em> I found out he was <em>the definition</em> of a <strong>career politician</strong>.</p>
