<h2>Canadian Politics</h2>
<p>At this point I'm looking at an extremely unserious person using social media divisiveness to try and take power in my country.</p>
<p>This bothers me somewhat.</p>
<p>It's also sort've... ironic? How the so-called &quot;Social Media Prime Minister&quot; <a href="justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> is about to be defeated by a walking oxymoron.</p>
<p><a href="pierre-poilievre">Pierre's</a> behaviour appears simply villainous to me, and that was <em>before</em> I found out he was <em>the definition</em> of a <strong>career politician</strong>.</p>
