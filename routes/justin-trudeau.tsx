    <h1>Justin Trudeau</h1>

<p>I was living in downtown Kelowna and hiking Knox had become a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>A jog down the beach and you were there, and the views of the lake and city were incentive on their own.</p>
<p>The radio mentioned that the PM would be in town and was scheduled to hike Knox.</p>
<p>My then-partner wanted to get a photo with him and so we figured we'd meet him at the peak.</p>
<p>I found myself more fascinated and preoccupied with the armed, plainclothes officers we encountered on our otherwise regular hike.</p>
<p>I'd met a few politicians before, but none with secret, armed pre-eminent escorts.</p>
<p>When the PM arrived he shook hands with us and another couple that had been waiting for the meeting. Someone took a photo for us.</p>
<p>Afterwards, while conversing with my then-partner, she remarked that</p>
<p>&quot;I looked into his eyes and it was like there was nobody there&quot;</p>
<p>and I had no rebuttal.</p>
<p>My personal opinion was that he was a kind've a plain guy, unremarkable really if not for his excessive company.</p>
<p>I appreciated that he was participating in a hobby I enjoyed; jogging down a mountain path.</p>
<p>Beyond that... what do I really even know about him? Not much.</p>
