<h2>EXPAND MAID NOW</h2>
<ol>
<li>Expanded Eligibility</li>
</ol>
<p>Eligibility requirements should be dropped and all consenting participants ought be registered and processed at the most expedient rate possible.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Separate From Healthcare</li>
</ol>
<p>MAID will be made available outside of the healthcare system, which will no longer be serving people over the age of 65.</p>
<h2>AUTO-REGISTRATION</h2>
<p>All Canadians over the age of 55 are automatically enrolled in MAID free of charge in preparation for turning 65 when they are removed from the public healthcare system.</p>
<p>This change will reduce friction for transitioning citizens.</p>
