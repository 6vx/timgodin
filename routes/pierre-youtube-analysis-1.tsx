<h2>description</h2>
<p>Thirty seven second video showing mostly news footage of food banks being used, followed by nine (5 and 4, sliced together?) out-of-context words clipped from a Justin Trudeau speech.</p>
<h2>analysis</h2>
<p>The title implies a negative motive from Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>The footage implies that food bank usage is ominous and scary.</p>
<p>The out of context Trudeau comment, juxtaposed against the food bank footage, implies that Trudeau is at fault, uncaring, and out of touch.</p>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>Pierre Poilievre uses out of context quotes to sow divisiveness</p>
<p>In 'the online world' this is called 'clip-chimping'.</p>
<p>From fluentslang.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &quot;<strong>clip chimp</strong>&quot; is slang that originated in the Twitch community and refers to a Twitch user who creates and shares out-of-context clips from a streamer’s channel. These clips are often shared on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter in an attempt to embarrass streamers and gain online popularity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words; Pierre is monkeying around with <a href="canadian-politics">Canadian Politics</a>.</p>
